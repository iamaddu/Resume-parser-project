# ‚úÖ EVERYTHING COMPLETE - FINAL SUMMARY

## What I Just Fixed & Created

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Filter Buttons Issue
**Problem:** Clicking filter buttons cleared all results and went back to initial stage

**Solution:** Added session state persistence
- Results now stored in `st.session_state.results`
- Clicking filters no longer clears data
- All filter buttons now work correctly

**Test:** Run app, process resumes, click "NEURAL SELECTED" - results persist!
