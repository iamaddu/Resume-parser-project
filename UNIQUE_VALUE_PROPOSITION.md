# ðŸŽ¯ NeuroMatch AI - Unique Value Proposition

## What Makes Us Different (USPs)

### 1. **Explainable AI - Complete Transparency**

**Our Solution:** Every decision comes with:
- Component-level score breakdown (6 dimensions)
- Specific reasons for selection/rejection
- Skills matched vs missing with learning time
- Red flag detection with explanations
- Salary justification based on experience/skills

**Why It Matters:** HR can defend hiring decisions, comply with regulations, and provide feedback to candidates.

**Our Solution:** 
- 100% local processing
- No external API calls
- No data leaves your environment
- GDPR/CCPA compliant by design
- No vendor lock-in

**Why It Matters:** Protect sensitive candidate information, meet regulatory requirements, maintain competitive advantage.

**Why It Matters:** Works with your actual workflow, not an idealized one.

**Why It Matters:** Regulatory compliance, legal defensibility, stakeholder trust.
