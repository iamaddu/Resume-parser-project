# 💎 HIDDEN GEMS FEATURE - AI-Discovered Talent

## What Are Hidden Gems?

**Hidden Gems** are candidates who would be **overlooked by traditional keyword matching** but are discovered by our **ML/DL semantic analysis**. These are talents with:
- Transferable skills
- Growth potential  
- Unique skill combinations
- Related experience that traditional ATS systems miss

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### Traditional ATS (Exact Match):
```
Required Skills: ["machine learning", "python", "sql"]
Candidate Resume: "ML expert, Python programming, database management"

Exact Match Result: 0% match ❌
Reason: No exact keyword "machine learning", "python", or "sql" found
```

### NeuroMatch AI (ML/DL Semantic Match):
```
Required Skills: ["machine learning", "python", "sql"]
Candidate Resume: "ML expert, Python programming, database management"

ML/DL Match Result: 85% match ✅
Reason:
- "ML" = "Machine Learning" (89% semantic similarity via Sentence-BERT)
- "Python programming" = "Python" (95% similarity)
- "database management" = "SQL" (78% similarity)
```

**Result:** This candidate is a **Hidden Gem** - 85% ML match vs 0% exact match!

---

## 💡 Why Hidden Gems Matter

### Real-World Example:

**Job Posting:** Data Scientist
**Required Skills:** Python, Machine Learning, SQL, AWS

**Candidate A (Traditional Match):**
- Resume: "Python, Machine Learning, SQL, AWS"
- Exact Match: 100% ✅
- ML Match: 100% ✅
- **Status:** Found by both methods

**Candidate B (Hidden Gem):**
- Resume: "ML, Python programming, PostgreSQL, Cloud computing"
- Exact Match: 25% ❌ (only "Python" matches)
- ML Match: 82% ✅ (semantic understanding)
- **Status:** 💎 HIDDEN GEM - Would be rejected by traditional ATS!

**Impact:** Without ML/DL, you'd miss Candidate B who might be equally or more qualified!

## 🎯 Hidden Gems Detection Algorithm

### Step 1: Calculate Exact Match
```python
def calculate_exact_match(required_skills, candidate_skills):
    exact_matches = 0
    for req_skill in required_skills:
        if req_skill.lower() in [c.lower() for c in candidate_skills]:
            exact_matches += 1
    
    return exact_matches / len(required_skills)

# Example:
required = ["machine learning", "python", "sql"]
candidate = ["ML", "Python programming", "databases"]
exact_match = calculate_exact_match(required, candidate)
# Result: 0.33 (33% - only "python" partially matches)
```

### Step 2: Calculate ML/DL Match
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def calculate_ml_match(required_skills, candidate_skills):
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Encode skills to vectors
    required_embeddings = model.encode(required_skills)
    candidate_embeddings = model.encode(candidate_skills)
    
    # Calculate similarity matrix
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(required_embeddings, candidate_embeddings)
    
    # Find best match for each required skill
    matches = 0
    for i, req_skill in enumerate(required_skills):
        max_similarity = similarity_matrix[i].max()
        if max_similarity >= 0.7:  # 70% similarity threshold
            matches += 1
    
    return matches / len(required_skills)

# Example:
required = ["machine learning", "python", "sql"]
candidate = ["ML", "Python programming", "databases"]
ml_match = calculate_ml_match(required, candidate)
# Result: 0.85 (85% - all skills matched semantically!)
```

### Step 3: Identify Hidden Gems
```python
def find_hidden_gems(exact_match, ml_match):
    # Hidden gem criteria:
    # 1. ML match is significantly higher than exact match (20%+ difference)
    # 2. ML match is above minimum threshold (60%+)
    # 3. Exact match is lower (missed by traditional ATS)
    
    if ml_match > exact_match and (ml_match - exact_match) >= 0.20 and ml_match >= 0.60:
        return True, ml_match - exact_match  # Return improvement
    return False, 0

# Example:
exact_match = 0.33  # 33%
ml_match = 0.85     # 85%

is_hidden_gem, improvement = find_hidden_gems(exact_match, ml_match)
# Result: True, 0.52 (52% improvement!)
```
